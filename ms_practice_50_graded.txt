Question 1 of 50

You have an Azure SQL Database named db1.

You need to provide access to db1 for a Microsoft Entra ID user .

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

In db1, run the CREATE USER statement with the FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER option.
This answer is correct.

In db1, run the CREATE USER statement with the FROM LOGIN option.

In the master database, run the CREATE LOGIN statement with the FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER option.

In the master database, run the CREATE LOGIN statement with the WITH PASSWORD option.
You should use the CREATE USER statement with FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER option in db1, as this user should have access to this database.

Using the CREATE USER statement with the FROM LOGIN or WITH PASSWORD option creates a login in the master database. By default, the login does not have any access to the databases.

This answer is correct.

Create a login and a user in the master database for db_readers.
You need to create a contained database user in the db1 database. The user must be assigned the db_datareader role for db1 to be able to read the data.

You should not create a user in the master database.

You should not assign the db_accessadmin role to the user because this role allows you to manage security assignments for other roles.

You should not assign the db_datareader role to the user for the master database because the user must read data from db1.

You should not assign the db_denydatawriter role to the user for db1 because this role prevents data changes in the database but is unrelated to data selection.

Create a login and a database user in db1 for the dbadmin group.
This answer is correct.

Create a login and a database user in the master database for the dbadmin group.
This answer is incorrect.
You should create a login and a database user in db1 for the dbadmin group, because members of the dbadmin group need a user in the db1 database. Members of the db_securityadmin role can modify role membership for custom roles.

The remaining options are incorrect. Members of the dbadmin group do not need server level permissions. Members of the sysadmin role can perform any activity on the instance. Members of the db_accessadmin role can add and remove access to the database. Members of the loginmanager role can create and delete logins in the virtual master database.

This answer is correct.

Connect to db2 and run EXECUTE sp_set_database_firewall_rule Allow db2 users, '10.0.2.0', '10.0.2.255';.
This answer is correct.

Connect to the master database and run EXECUTE sp_set_database_firewall_rule Allow db1 users, '10.0.1.0', '10.0.1.255';.

Connect to the master database and run EXECUTE sp_set_database_firewall_rule Allow db2 users, '10.0.2.0', '10.0.2.255';.

Connect to the master database and run EXECUTE sp_set_firewall_rule Allow db1 and db2 users, '10.0.1.0', '10.0.2.255';.
This answer is incorrect.
Connecting to db1 and running EXECUTE sp_set_database_firewall_rule Allow db1 users, '10.0.1.0', '10.0.1.255'; will set the database firewall on db1 to allow the correct IP addresses.

Connecting to db2 and running EXECUTE sp_set_database_firewall_rule Allow db2 users, '10.0.2.0', '10.0.2.255'; will set the database firewall on db2 to allow the correct IP addresses.

The remaining options are incorrect. Connecting to the master database and running EXECUTE sp_set_firewall_rule Allow db1 and db2 users, '10.0.1.0', '10.0.2.255'; will set the server firewall to allow the IP addresses for both sets of users to access all databases.

Connecting to the master database and running EXECUTE sp_set_database_firewall_rule Allow db2 users, '10.0.2.0', '10.0.2.255'; will set the database firewall on the master database to allow the IP addresses for db2 users.

Question 7 of 50

You have an Azure SQL Database that contains a table named Employee. The table has columns that are masked by using dynamic data masking.

When a user copies the Employee table by using the SELECT INTO command, the data is masked in a new table. The user must see the unmasked data in the new table.

You need to grant the appropriate permissions to the user. The solution must follow the principle of least privilege.

What should you grant to the user?

Select only one answer.

the ALTER ANY MASK permission

the SELECT permission for the new table

the UNMASK permission for the Employee table
This answer is correct.

the UNMASK permission for the new table
This answer is incorrect.
You should grant the UNMASK permission to the user for the Employee table because data must be unmasked before copying it to the new table.

Granting the UNMASK permission to the user for the new table does not allow the user to see the unmasked data in the new table, as the data cannot be unmasked after it is copied to the new table.

The ALTER ANY MASK permission is dedicated to the security officer as it allows that management of dynamic data masking, and the SELECT permission does not make masked data readable.

Apply a sensitivity classification to the column.
This answer is correct.

Configure a Log Analytics audit log destination.

Configure a Storage audit log destination.
This answer is correct.

Enable Always Encrypted for the column.

Enable Azure SQL Auditing.
This answer is correct.

Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).
This answer is incorrect.
Azure SQL Auditing needs to be enabled to monitor access. A storage account allows unlimited retention. The column needs a classification label so that access is audited.

Log Analytics has a maximum retention limit of seven years, Always Encrypted is used to protect data in use or in transit, and TDE encrypts data files.

You have an Azure SQL Database named db1 that contains a table. The table contains a column that stores email addresses.

You need to ensure that reporting users can only view email addresses in a format of aXXX@XXX.com. The solution must minimize the impact on other users.

What should you configure?

Select only one answer.

Always Encrypted

column encryption

dynamic data masking
This answer is correct.

row-level security (RLS)
This answer is incorrect.
Dynamic data masking will enable users to only see masked values instead of email addresses.

Always Encrypted protects data in use or in transit. RLS controls access to rows in a table, and column encryption will encrypt the data in the column, which can hinder users’ ability to view the data.

Question 11 of 50

You need to recommend a high-availability and disaster recovery (HA/DR) strategy for a SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines instance. The solution must meet the following requirements:

All databases, including system databases, must be protected.
SQL Server Agent jobs must be protected.
Downtime must be minimized.
The failover process must be done automatically.
What should you include in the recommendation?

Select only one answer.

an Always On availability group

an Always On failover cluster instance
This answer is correct.

log shipping

transactional replication
This answer is incorrect.
You should recommend an Always On failover cluster instance because this feature protects the entire instance. A SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines instance is the entire installation of Microsoft SQL Server, such as binaries and all the objects inside the instance, including logins, SQL Server Agent jobs, and databases. Instance-level protection means that the entire instance is accounted for in the availability feature.

An Always On availability group works at the database level rather than the instance level. Transactional replication cannot replicate system databases, and neither transactional replication nor log shipping allow you to perform automatic failover.

What should you include in the recommendation?

Select only one answer.

availability sets

availability zones
This answer is correct.

Azure Backup

Azure Site Recovery
This answer is incorrect.
You should recommend availability zones, as they account for datacenter-level failure in Azure.

Availability sets provide uptime against Azure-related maintenance and single points of failure in a single datacenter, Azure Site Recovery replicates workloads running on physical and virtual machines from a primary site to a secondary location, and Azure Backup is used to provide independent and isolated backups to guard against the unintended destruction of the data on your virtual machines.

Question 13 of 50

You have an Azure SQL Managed Instance that contains a database named db1. You have a backup of db1.

You need to restore db1 to the point in time of the backup.

Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

Select all answers that apply.

Drop db1.
This answer is correct.

Restore db1 from a file.

Restore db1 from a URL.
This answer is correct.

Set db1 to single-user mode.
This answer is incorrect.
You should drop the existing database first because the existing database cannot be overwritten on the SQL managed instance. You should also restore the database db1 from a URL.

Setting db1 to single-user mode is not allowed on the SQL managed instance, and while the SQL managed instance allows you to perform a manual database restore from a URL, it does not allow you to restore the database from a tape or disk.

Question 14 of 50

You have a SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines instance.

During a weekly maintenance task, you discover that a database named db1 has consistency errors.

You plan to restore the database from backups.

Which command should you run before you run the RESTORE command?

Select only one answer.

ALTER DATABASE db1 SET EMERGENCY

ALTER DATABASE db1 SET OFFLINE

ALTER DATABASE db1 SET RESTRICTED_USER

ALTER DATABASE db1 SET SINGLE_USER
This answer is correct.
You should run the ALTER DATABASE db1 SET SINGLE_USER command, as only one user at a time can access the database. If you specify SINGLE_USER, and another user connects to the database, the ALTER DATABASE command is blocked until all users disconnect from the specified database. This is the command that should be run before the RESTORE command is run.

Running the ALTER DATABASE db1 SET EMERGENCY command would not work because the database is marked as READ_ONLY, logging is disabled, and access is limited to members of the sysadmin fixed server role.

By running ALTER DATABASE db1 SET OFFLINE, the database will shut down, and you cannot perform the restore operation. You cannot modify a database while it is offline.

Running the ALTER DATABASE db1 SET RESTRICTED_USER command allows for only members of the db_owner fixed database role dbcreator, and fixed server roles to connect to the database.

What should you configure?

Select only one answer.

differential backup frequency

long-term retention
This answer is correct.

point-in-time-restore
This answer is incorrect.
A long-term retention policy allows you to specify how many weeks, months, and years a backup should be kept. The maximum time is 10 years.

A point-in-time-restore policy only allow you to keep backups for 35 days, and a differential backup frequency policy specifies how often you want differential backup to be taken.

This answer is correct.

transaction log
This answer is correct.
To configure a backup maintenance solution and ensure that the databases can be restored to any point in time, a full database backup and a transaction log backup are required.

A copy-only backup is a SQL Server backup that is independent of the sequence of conventional SQL Server backups. A file backup contains all the data in one or more files, and a filegroup backup contains all the data in one or more filegroups.

You need to ensure that all databases can be restored to any point-in-time.

Which three actions should you include in the solution? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

Select all answers that apply.

Include a full database backup
This answer is correct.

Include a log backup
This answer is correct.

Set the bulk logged recovery model

Set the Continue on error option

Set the Copy-only backup option

Set the full recovery model
This answer is correct.
Both full and transaction log database backups are required. The database must be set to the full recovery model.

You should not set the database to the bulk recovery model, as there are situations where the bulk recovery model does not allow you to set the point-in-time recovery.

The Copy-only option is used to perform a backup that is used independently of conventional backups. This is not useful when building the disaster recovery strategy.

The Continue on error option is used when you must perform a backup during the disaster.

You need to recommend a partitioning method for the table. The solution must meet the following requirements:

The data must be kept for 2 years.
All data older than two years must be removed once a month.
Performance of data removal operations must be maximized.
Which three actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

Select all answers that apply.

Create a partition function for each month.
This answer is correct.

Create a partition function for each year.

Create a partition schema for filegroups for each year.

Create a partition schema for the PRIMARY filegroup.
This answer is correct.

Create the table by using the partition schema on the StockItemTransactionID column.

Create the table by using the partition schema on the TransactionOccurredWhen column.
This answer is correct.
The data must be removed each month so it will be more efficient to create a partition function for each month. You can only use the PRIMARY filegroup in Azure SQL Database, and the data should be partitioned on datetime.

Also, because the data must be removed each month, it will be less efficient to create a partition for each year. You cannot create filegroups in Azure SQL Database.

You need to implement table partitioning for a table in db1.

You create the filegroups.

What should you do next?

Select only one answer.

Create a partition function, create a partition scheme, and then create a table on the partition function.

Create a partition function, create a partition scheme, and then create a table on the partition scheme.
This answer is correct.

Create a partition function, create a table on the partition function, and then change the fill factor settings on indexes.

Create a partition scheme, create a table on the partition scheme, and then change the fill factor settings on indexes.
This answer is incorrect.
You should first create a partition function to define how the rows in a table or index map to a set of partitions based on the values of a partitioning column. Then you should create a partition scheme, which is a database object that maps the partitions of a partition function to one filegroup or to multiple filegroups. Finally, you should create a table specifying the partition scheme.

You should not create a table specifying the partition function, as a partition scheme is needed, nor should you change the fill factor settings for the indexes, as these settings relate to the free space at the index page level.

sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats
This answer is incorrect.
You should query the sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats view, as it returns size and fragmentation information for the data and indexes of the specified table or view in Microsoft SQL Server. For an index, one row is returned for each level of the B-tree in each partition. For a heap, one row is returned for the IN_ROW_DATA allocation unit of each partition. You should also query the sys.dm_db_column_store_row_group_physical_stats view because it provides current rowgroup-level information about all the columnstore indexes in the current database. Based on the information, you can calculate the index fragmentation.

The sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats view returns counts of different types of index operations and the time each type of operation was last performed, and the sys.dm_db_index_operational_stats view returns current lower-level I/O, locking, latching, and access method activity for each partition of a table or index in the database.
